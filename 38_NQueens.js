This problem was asked by Microsoft.

You have an N by N board. Write a function that, given N, returns the number of possible arrangements of the board where 
N queens can be placed on the board without threatening each other, i.e. no two queens share the same row, column, or diagonal.

******** Solution *********
***************************
If we were to attempt to solve this problem using brute force, we would quickly find out that it would be prohibitively 
expensive. Consider a typical 8 by 8 board: we have 64 spots to place 8 queens, so that's 64 choose 8 possible placements. 
In general, that's factorial in runtime!

This problem is ripe for solving with backtracking. In backtracking, we can visualize the search space like a tree, and 
we would explore it depth-first. Each node would be a possible configuration. If the configuration contains eight queens 
and is valid, then we're done and we can add it to our count. Otherwise, we can try to place another queen somewhere on the 
board and search from there. If we encounter an invalid board, then we can just prune the entire subtree from our search
 -- there's no point in exploring a board that we know won't work.

Notice we can pare down the search space by ensuring we only place queens in distinct rows, since we know that two queens 
can never occupy the same row.

Now we can just represent the board as a one-dimensional array of max size N, where each value represents which column the 
queen is on. For example, one solution for N = 4 would just be [1, 3, 0, 2].

def n_queens(n, board=[]):
    if n == len(board):
        return 1

    count = 0
    for col in range(n):
        board.append(col)
        if is_valid(board):
            count += n_queens(n, board)
        board.pop()
    return count

def is_valid(board):
    current_queen_row, current_queen_col = len(board) - 1, board[-1]
    # Iterate over all already-placed queens and check if any of them can attack
    # each other.
    for row, col in enumerate(board[:-1]):
        diff = abs(current_queen_col - col)
        if diff == 0 or diff == current_queen_row - row:
            return False
    return True

If you're interested in optimizing this problem even further, check out this paper that uses constant space by representing
 all columns and diagonals simply with integers! However, this depends on n being smaller than the number of bits in your 
 integer.
